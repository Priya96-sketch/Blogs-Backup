## GitHub Profile README with View Counter

*GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile-level README to showcase. This article walksthrough how to access this new feature.* 

### **Why READMEs?**
The GitHub profile-level README feature allows more content than the profile bio, the README is significantally more visible as it is placed above pinned repositories and supports markdown which means you can play around with the content more visually.

A solid README is a core-component of well-documented software and often encourages collaboration by sharing helpful context with contributors.

*I'm getting the error message because I have already created one.* 

### **How do I create a profile README?**

* Step 1: Creating a new repository that’s the same name(including casing) as your username. 
For example, my GitHub username is *ayushi7rawat* so I created a new repository with the name *ayushi7rawat* 

* Step 2: Create a README.md file and add your fancy code there

* Step 3: Once done you can Commit your new README!

*What if you already have a repository with the same name? I’d recommend renaming the existing project, or if possible, changing the content of the README file.*

My profile README is relatively simple. You can see how it looks like by checking my [GitHub](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat) profile.
