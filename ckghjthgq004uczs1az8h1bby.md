## Introduction

Screenshot, also known as screen capture, is a digital image that shows the contents of a computer display. A common screenshot is created by the operating system or software running on the device. **Taking**, saving, and sharing **screenshots** can be extremely helpful. 

## What will be covered in this Blog

```
1. PyAutoGUI Introduction
2. How to capture Screenshot using python
```

## What is PyAutoGUI?

PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. 

**Features**

- Moving the mouse and clicking or typing in the windows of other applications.
- Sending keystrokes to applications (for example, to fill out forms).
- Take screenshots, and given an image (for example, of a button or checkbox), find it on the screen.
- Locate an applicationâ€™s window, and move, resize, maximize, minimize, or close it (Windows-only, currently)
- Display message boxes for user interaction while your GUI automation script runs.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [PyAutoGUI Documentation](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Use this link to navigate to the documentation.

Now that you are aware of PyAutoGUI basics, we can move forward to the coding section. 

## Time to code!

You can find all the code at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat/Youtube-Projects/tree/master/Screenshot%20taker%20app). **Drop a star** if you find it useful.

### Installing PyAutoGUI 

Open your terminal and run the following command

```python
pip install PyAutoGUI
```

Now that we have the package, we are ready to import it in our python script.

```python
import pyautogui
import tkinter as tk
```

Now, its time to create a canvas. Let's give it a title. I am setting `Sc taker` as the title using the `title` method. You can specify the canvas dimensions. I am setting the `height` and `width` as `300`. 

```python
root= tk.Tk()
root.title('Sc taker')
canvas1 = tk.Canvas(root, width = 300, height = 300)
```

Now, let's pack our Canvas using the `pack` method. 

```python
canvas1.pack()
```

Now that we have our canvas ready, lets define a function to capture screenshot. I am naming it as `myScreenshot`. 

We need to create an object to store our screenshot. I am naming it as `sc`. So, we will call `screenshot` method from `PyAutoGUI` on `sc`. 

```python
def myScreenshot():
  myScreenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()

  myScreenshot.save(r'C:\Users\imar\Desktop\Python Tutotial\screenshot1.png')
```

Let's save our screenshot using the `save` method,. Give proper path along with the screenshot name. 

Now, let's create a button and specify few parameters. 

- I am setting the `text` of the button as `Take Screenshot`. 
- I am passing my function `myScreenshot` in `command`.
- `Background` and `foreground` color as `green` and `white` respectively.
- And finally, I am setting the `font` as `15`.

```python
myButton = tk.Button(text='Take Screenshot', command=myScreenshot, bg='green',fg='white',font= 15)
```

Now that our button is ready, let's put it in the center.

```python
canvas1.create_window(150, 150, window=myButton)
```

At last, we will call our `mainloop`.

```python
root.mainloop()
```

Our Python script is ready. Run the program and you will see something like this.

![Screenshot_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603163729371/OdMY82v4n.png)

When you click the `Take Screenshot` button. A new screenshot will be captured and saved in your specified path.

That's it! simple, isn't it?
