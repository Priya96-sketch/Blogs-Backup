Let us see how I have automated Teams so that it automatically logs into one's meetings/classes on time.

### Pre-requisites:

```
- Microsoft Teams application
- Python
- Pyautogui
``` 

### Microsoft Teams application
**MS Teams** is a popular chat and video conferencing app which allows us to attend/conduct meetings.

You can download it by clicking at the  [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) 

### PyAutoGui
PyAutoGUI is a cross-platform GUI automation Python module. It programmatically controls the mouse & keyboard. It has screenshot features and image finding features.
PyAutoGUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and runs on Python 2 and 3.

You can refer to the Pyautogui's  [documentation](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

**Installation**

```
pip install pyautogui
``` 
The source is available on https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui

### Time to Code!

### Now let's Understand theÂ code.
An infinite loop keeps checking the current time of the system using this  function.
```
datetime.now()
``` 

**Necessary modules**

we will import the necessary modules.
```
import os             
import pyautogui
import time
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime
``` 
Before startUp, make sure that the Teams application is closed.

**Opening Teams**
The Teams app is opened using 
```
os.startfile()
``` 

```
os.startfile("C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Teams/current/Teams.exe")
``` 
**locateCenterOnScreen()**

pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen() function locates the center of the first found instance of the image on the screen.

Capture the screenshot of *settings button *and use the below chunk of code to move the mouse to that button and click it.


![settings.PNG](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599338504701/baPxPX9yx.png)

```
pyautogui.moveTo()
``` 
moves the cursor to that location.

```
pyautogui.click()
``` 
performs a click operation.


```
settings = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("settings.PNG") 
pyautogui.moveTo(settings)
pyautogui.click()
time.sleep(2)
``` 
Moving forward, we need to click on *Manage Teams* button to get a list of teams vertically.


```
manageteams = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("manageteams.PNG") 
pyautogui.moveTo(manageteams)
pyautogui.click()
time.sleep(2)
``` 
Next, you will get the Teams List tab screen.

Now we run the below code snippet in an infinite loop.

We get the current time and compare it with the class ending time.

*For example,*

If the current time is 10:00 and my class is at 10:00 but the meeting has started. If I give my class ending time i.e 11:00 then as soon as the meeting starts the scripts automatically clicks on join button with camera and microphone turned off.


- Capture screenshot of your class name.
DemoMeetOne and DemoMeetTwo in my case

- Similarily Join button

- Camera and microphone too.

![audiooff.PNG](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599338622515/dJKJKXH20.png)

```
if now < '18:00':
    DemoMeetOne=pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("DemoMeetOne.PNG") 
    pyautogui.moveTo(DemoMeetOne)
    pyautogui.click()
    time.sleep(2)
    join = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("join.PNG") 
    pyautogui.moveTo(join)
    pyautogui.click()
    time.sleep(2)
    audiooff = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("audiooff.PNG") 
    pyautogui.moveTo(audiooff)
    pyautogui.click()
    time.sleep(2)
``` 
I have done it for 2 classes.

- DemoMeetOne

- DemoMeetTwo
you can do it for any number of classes you want.
