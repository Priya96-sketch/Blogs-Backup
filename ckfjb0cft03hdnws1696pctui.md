According to the 2018 Jetbrains Python Developers Survey, Django and Flask are by far the two most popular Python web frameworks. A web developer has the option to choose from a wide range of web frameworks while using Python as server-side programming languages. To help you make an informed choice between these frameworks, we will discuss what they are and a head to head comparison between the two.

## Types of Python frameworks
There are primarily three types of Python frameworks, namely :


1. **Full-stack framework:**
The frameworks which fall under this category are CubicWeb, Django, Giotto, Pylons, Pyramid etc
2. **Micro-framework :**
The frameworks which fall under this category are Bottle, CherryPy, Dash, Falcon, Flask etc
3. **Asynchronous framework:**
The frameworks which fall under this category are AIOHTTP, Growler, Sanic etc

## The introduction:

**Django:**

Django was created in 2005 and is a **Full-stack framework** written in Python. It is a free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-views architectural pattern. It has a big number of built-in features making it the most preferred web development frameworks for developing Python applications.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to the [Django Documentation]( https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/)

**Flask:**

Flask was created in 2010  and is a popular **Microframework** written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to the [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

1. Flask support Visual Debug whereas Django do not support for Visual Debug.

2. Flask is a Python web framework built for rapid development whereas Django is a Python web framework built to make projects easy and simple.

3. Flask allows you to use multiple types of databases whereas Django doesn't offer multiple types of databases.

4. Flask does not offer dynamic HTML pages whereas Django offers dynamic HTML pages.

5. Flask web framework uses a Ninja2 template design. Django web framework helps you to utilizes the View web templating system.

11. Flask does not offer a built-in bootstrapping tool whereas Django-admin enables developers to start building web applications without any external input.

12. Flask supports an extension which could be implemented in the framework. Django has its own module library. So, it stores several prewritten codes.

## Conclusion:

Django is a full-stack , fast, has advanced features like automating user authentication, site maps, RSS feeds, etc., secured operations, scalable development allowing websites to full-fill heavy traffic demands every time and portable.

Flask is it is lightweight, open source, and offer minimal coding for developing an application has URL Routing advantage that is loved by developers and API is flexible and aligns with most of the web development needs.

If you are looking for simplicity and flexibility, then Flask might be a good choice. If, however, you are talking about a complex web application with customized functionalities and features, then Django might be a better fit.
