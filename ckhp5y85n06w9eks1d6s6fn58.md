## What does successful blogging means to me?

Hello World! 

I am attending a [Technical Writing Bootcamp](https://hashnode.com/bootcamp/batch-2) at @hashnode. **Hashnode Bootcamp II** is a free virtual Bootcamp to help beginner technical writers to improve their writing skill.

This article is inspired by the latest session by **Michaela Greiler**, @dailydevtips, she suggested to write about what does successful blogging mean.

In this Blog article, I will share my thoughts on the same.

Success has different meaning to different people. For me, the reason lies in the question **Why I started writing a Blog?**

### **Why I started writing a Blog?**

I like to read and I read a lot but writing never crossed my mind. I have a habit of documenting my learning. 

I like to document my work. One day I was surfing the Internet and landed up on a very well drafted blog and  it strike me that everytime I get stuck, I google.

Google then redirects to a webpage or a blog post, if it helps me then maybe I can write one. 

**GOAL:** Most people fear to take the first step and do not have the courage to cross the barrier, and trust me starting off is the toughest part and I can relate to it. So, with that in mind, I wanted to help people, like me who are to start their journey as a developer and make the Community a better place for developers.

### What does successful blog means to me?

It is a process, blogging helped me realise that negative feedback are as important as the positive ones. People seek only for positive ones and ignore the negatives. ! Negative ones help you grow, I try to get analyse feedback and improve myself.

- If people benefit from what I write,
-  If it solves their problem, 
- If it helps them grow or motivate them

I feel I am successful at my blog.

### Final Thoughts

You need not be perfect to start a blog.

I am learning Python, Blogging is a wonderful medium to share my learning with other people, It in turn helps me learn faster and better.

I wish to continue writing and you should too. It will help you in ways, you cannot imagine.
