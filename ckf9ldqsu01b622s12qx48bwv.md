## Git Hack: Make commit with a past date

*Ever wanted to commit something to a git repo with a past date? Hereâ€™s how you could do it.*

If you are working on a project and missed a commit yesterday or you accomplished the task but GitHub for Windows bailed on you? Well, this little hack can solve your problem.

Pre-Step.
*Pull all data from remote to local repository.*

For the same, we are using the --amend and --date switches.
The exact command is as follows:

```$ git commit --amend --date="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"```

Simple, isn't it!

This should solve your problem. If you have any Queries or Suggestions, please reach out to me in the Comments Section below.
