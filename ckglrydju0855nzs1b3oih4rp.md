Notifications help people to remember things. It is a small piece of text which appears on the desktop or mobile screen to inform the user about the updates or any other important pieces of information. 

## What is Plyer?

Plyer is a Python library for accessing features of your hardware / platforms.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [Plyer Documentation](https://plyer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Use this link to navigate to the documentation.

## **Other areas where you can use this approach**

1. Set daily tracker for COVID stats
2. Daily notification to take medicine.
3. Hourly notification to drink water.

and many more, itâ€™s completely up to you how to use this application. 

Now that you are aware of Desktop Notification and Plyer basics, we can move forward to the coding section. 

## Time to code!

You can find all the code at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat/Youtube-Projects/tree/master/Desktop%20Notifier). **Drop a star** if you find it useful.

### Installing Plyer

Open your terminal and run the following command

```python
pip install plyer
```

Now that we have the package, we are ready to import it in our python script.

```python
from plyer import notification
```

Now let's specify the parameters. Lets define the `title` and `message`.

```python
title = 'Hello Amazing people!'

message= 'Thankyou for reading! Take care!'
```

Let's look at what the parameters mean:

- `title`: Title of the notification
- `message`: Message of the notification
- `app_name`: Name of the app launching this notification
- `app_icon`: Icon to be displayed along with the message
- `timeout`: time to display the message for, defaults to 10
- `ticker`: text to display on the status bar as the notification arrives
- `toast`: simple message instead of full notification

Now, let's pass the parameters using `notify` method.

```python
notification.notify(title= title,
                    message= message,
                    app_icon = None,
                    timeout= 10,
                    toast=False)
```

I am passing:

- the `title` as  `'Hello Amazing people!'``
- ``message` as `'Thankyou for reading! Take care!'`
- `app_icon` as `None`
- `timeout` as `10 secs`
- and `toast` as `False`.

That's it! We are done. Now let's save and run our python script.
